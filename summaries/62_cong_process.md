## Congressional Process/ Lewis Froman Jr.

### Cong/Pres. Diff.

...presidential candidates with any chance of winning must appeal to the interests in large states. For example, it is possible for a candidate to be elected President by winning pluralities in the 11 largest states, plus the District of Columbia, while losing all 39 other states. By and large the populous states are also two-party states with large urban populations. Metropolitan areas within these states have significantly large minority groups (such as Negroes, and various ethnic and religious minorities). ... winning presidential candidates tend to pay attention to relatively more "liberal" interests who favor and promote change in the status quo in a direction benefiting them. Domestic presidential programs, therefore, usually emphasize these kinds of changes

Congressional interests, on the other hand, are relatively more "conservative" and status quo conscious. This is because there are two senators from each state, regardless of population, so that, for example, the 26 smallest states with 52 senators (a majority) гер-resent only 17 percent of the population. The other 48 senators represent 83 percent of the population. In fact a majority of the population (over 51 percent) is represented by only 18 senators, far less than a majority of the Senate. ...Malapportionment of legislative seats in the House of Refresentatives is another factor contributing to the conservative ritige of Congress.

### Anti-Party Voting

during the Eighty-eighth Congress (1963-64) there were 337 roll-call votes in the House and the Senate on which a majority of Democrats opposed a majority of Republicans. On these roll calls the average Democrat voted against his party 31 percent of the time, the average Republican 29 percent. For the Eighty-seventh Congress (1961-62) the comparable figures were 30 percent for each party.

### Time to Committee Chair

House Chairmen in the Eighty-eighth Congress (1963-64) took an average of 16.35 years after entering the House to attain committee chairmanships and an average of 13.3 years after gaining a seat on the committee. The comparable figures for the Senate are 12.56 years after entering the Senate and 11.4 years after gaining a seat on the committee. It
