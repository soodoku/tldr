## India: A Portrait

### Contemporaries



* Sanjay Gandhi
	* The boys were brought up in large part by servants, including a stern Danish governess who insisted on cold showers and raw vegetables.
	* Sanjay was more outgoing, though at the age of six he had not yet learned to speak.
	* by his late teens, Sanjay was being accused of stealing and joyriding cars around Delhi.
	* Previously, he was famous only for getting a licence to run a car factory which was unable to produce cars. After being given the opportunity ... The Maruti project sucked in money for years from nationalized banks and private investors
	* A friend of the family, the writer Khushwant Singh, remembered arriving at a meeting with him and watching a pair of supplicatory businessmen deliver two suitcases full of banknotes. “I found it hard not to like Sanjay,” he admitted, “but I have to say he was a thug, and he was corrupt.”
	* Sanjay Gandhi crashed while performing aerobatics over Delhi—illegally, one morning—in a Pitts S-2A light aeroplane.

* Indira Gandhi
	* if highly dubious swami named Dhirendra Brahmachari, who ran a gun factory, did yoga performances on national television and knew how to perform some of the more obscure Tantric rituals.
	* The root cause was a conflict she and the late Sanjay had sparked in Punjab by attempting to influence a state election. To break a local coalition in Punjab, Sanjay had set up and sponsored an obscure Sikh preacher, Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, as an alternative political force.
		* The assassin’s widow, Bimal Kaur Khalsa, became a martyr by proxy. She led a procession through Amritsar, was sent to jail on a charge of attempted murder and after her release was elected as an MP from Punjab.

* Rajiv Gandhi
	* His government passed a law allowing discrimination against Muslim women during divorce in order to woo conservative elements, which infuriated many Hindus; this was balanced by a court decision regarding a disputed mosque—the Babri Masjid—which appeared to
	* The prime minister’s office functioned in a haphazard and amateurish fashion, with the cabinet frequently being reshuffled. Rajiv Gandhi ignored corruption among his colleagues, and the payment of financial incentives became a growing part of Indian public life. 

* Sonia
	* Her father, Stephano, was a successful builder who had fought alongside the Wehrmacht against the Russians on the Eastern Front (he gave each of his daughters a Russian pet name, hence Sonia) and her mother, Paola, was a traditional housewife. Stephano remained an unrepentant fascist until his death, like many of his generation of Italian men, and kept a leather-bound edition of Mussolini’s

* Effect of Violence
	* the killing made people turn against the perceived philosophy behind the assassin
		* the Hindutva movement would for decades be tarred as violent and extremist. 
		* after Indira Gandhi was murdered, the campaign for a Sikh homeland was suppressed in a counter-insurgency campaign that left tens of thousands dead
		* Indian sympathy for the Tigers—which had never been very strong in the first place—evaporated after Rajiv Gandhi was blown up by a suicide bomber; it took until 2009 for the Tamil Tigers to be annihilated, but this was inevitable from 1991.

* Sonia's 'shatruvinash yog'
	* In June 2000, Rajesh Pilot died when his car collided with a Rajasthan State Road Transport bus
	* in October 2000, Sitaram Kesri passed away following a heart attack
	* in January 2001, the 62-year-old Jitendra Prasada suffered a sudden and fatal brain haemorrhage
	* in September 2001, Madhavrao Scindia was flying to Kanpur in an industrialist’s Cessna

* Pramod Mahajan
	* Despite being an RSS man, he was known for having an extravagant life.
	* Rahul Mahajan settled into the Jacuzzi in his father’s sprawling official residence, a short drive from the prime minister’s house. With him in the bathroom were his father’s secretary, Bibek Moitra, and several bottles of champagne. Later, they came out and had a small party accompanied by a bag of cocaine.

* Vajpayee
	* he had lived happily for many years with his college sweetheart, her husband and their daughters.

* Mahalanobis
	* Mahalanobis came to economics only in his forties, and had spent the 1920s pursuing subjects such as the pseudo-science of eugenics (he wished to discover the racial origins of Bengalis). He had written a paper, “Analysis of Race-Mixture in Bengal,” in which he recounted how by using “anthropological measurements such as stature, head-length, head-breadth, nasal length, etc. of 300 Anglo-Indians in Calcutta,” he had discovered that Anglo-Indians were taller than Bengalis and had variable head-lengths.
	* He invented a mathematical formula of “caste-distance” to determine the eugenic gap between Anglo-Indians and specific caste groups by contemplating variables, measurements and pooled variance."
	* Behind most of the catastrophic econ. decisions early on under Nehru
	* Here are some figures for capacity utilization in the heavy machine tool plant, in percentage terms, which show how the matrix did not work: ... These are not misprints: 3 percent of capacity, 11 percent of capacity.


* Ambedkar
	* Ambedkar for one was determined that the village, which he regarded as “a den of ignorance”
	* 2nd marriage to a Saraswat Brahmin
	* At school he was not allowed to touch a tap, and could only have water when a peon turned one on for him. He had to bring a piece of gunny cloth, or sacking, to class each day and sit or squat on it during lessons, while the upper-caste children sat at desks. At home, the family would cut each other’s hair and wash their own clothes,
	* His Mahar community was at the upper end of the scale of untouchability, respected in the region around Bombay for military service; he had won a scholarship sponsored by the Maharaja Gaekwad of Baroda ...

* Caste
	* Omprakash Valmiki, a Dalit, stated that during the 1960s he never once heard Ambedkar’s name “from a teacher’s or a scholar’s mouth.” ... Read Joothan
	* Kanshi Ram: "Brahminism had such poisonous germs in it, that it effectively killed the desire to revolt against the worst form of injustice."
	* Can't understand caste prejudice as 'It is unlike other forms of prejudice, where antipathy is linked to envy or desire; an anti-Semite will ask why “they” do so well in business, and a white racist will fear and envy apparent black physical prowess.'
	* An article published in 2009 mentioned that childless couples were asking sperm banks to label the donations by caste.


* Macro social
	* Indians, many of whom were Muslim, were working in the Middle East. They brought money and a new religious feeling to India, having developed a sense of commonality ... traditionally dressed young men began to propagate the idea of Islamic revival in Bombay, which in turn revived Hindu fears of Muslim fanaticism that had been
	* Hidden cameras/Corruption/Tehelka


* Colonial
	* This whole mechanism, along with civil and military salaries and pensions, was paid for by the Indian taxpayer: Indians had, without being asked, outsourced the running of their government to Britain.
	* At this point, only 6 percent of entrants to the civil service in India were Indian, since many practical obstacles stopped them from joining. A proposal by the Indian National Congress that the entrance examination be held not only in London but in Bombay, Calcutta and Madras was rejected; one British official inadvertently undermined the idea of racial superiority when he wrote that “half the service would be Bengali” if it were opened to this sort of competition, since Indian students were “infinitely quicker” at exams than Europeans.
	* Now, at the close of business nearly 350 years later, Britain was indebted in sterling to India to the tune of £1.3bn, through circumstances nobody had anticipated. In 1939 the debt had been running in the opposite direction, as the Indian government paid for the machinery of empire controlled in London.


* Massacres
	* in West Bengal, communist cadres had set upon lower-caste Bangladeshi settlers with the support of the police, burned and looted huts, raped women and murdered several hundred people, throwing their bodies into the river—Jyoti Basu, the veteran communist chief minister, did not express regret.
	* 1984
	* Gujarat


### Misc.

* "It did not escape the makers of the Constitution that other countries, such as Turkey, were seeking to promote unity by preventing minorities from using separate languages"

* "India retained the separate “civil codes” that had been created by the British after the mutiny or rebellion of 1857 to keep minority communities tame."

* "Walter Crocker, wrote: “If India is not run by dictators, Rightist, or Leftist, or Militarist, she will be run by politicians, more and more drawn from, or conditioned by, the outcastes and the low castes."

* When the French writer André Malraux asked the agnostic Nehru late in life what had been his most difficult task, he replied, “Creating a secular state in a religious country.”

* "Historical elision was required too: it became necessary to say the Muslim invasions of earlier centuries had been part of a give and take, a contest for political space which had brought new food and music to India, and did not mark any real cleavage with the Hindu majority."

* "After Nehru’s death, the democratic structures he had put in place came right: he had refused to groom or nominate a successor as prime minister, but it took Congress MPs only a week to choose a new leader, by consensus. He was Lal Bahadur Shastri, a small, impressive, scholarly man who had been born to a poor ..."

* Stereotypes
	* BENGAL 1 Bengali = poet 2 Bengalis = film society 3 Bengalis = political party 4 Bengalis = two political parties 
	* TAMIL BRAHMIN 1 Tam Brahm = priest at the Vardarajaperumal temple 2 Tam Brahms = maths tuition class 3 Tam Brahms = queue outside the U.S. consulate at 4 a.m. 4 Tam Brahms = Thyagaraja Music Festival in Santa Clara 
	* MALAYALI 1 Mallu = coconut stall 2 Mallus = boat race 3 Mallus = Gulf job racket 4 Mallus = oil slick
	* 1 Gujju = share-broker in a Mumbai train 2 Gujjus = rummy game in a Mumbai train 3 Gujjus = Mumbai’s noisiest restaurant 4 Gujjus = stock market scam

* Originally from Central Asia, Al-Biruni noticed the concentration on philosophy and mathematics, the emphasis on the purity of fire and water, the throwing away of earthen plates after use and the avoidance of touching between communities; he commented ... flexibility, observing that “at the utmost, they fight with words, but they will never stake their soul or body or their property on religious controversy"

* while the Democratic Indira Congress (Karunakaran), or DIC(K)

* P. Chidambaram, who in 2009 outraged the officials in the home ministry by introducing fingerprint scans to ensure everyone reached their office by 9 a.m. and only left at 5:30 p.m.

* Some Kashmir atrocities: "father’s friends was waylaid by terrorists, shot in his knees and then they sprayed pee on him, and after torture, he was shot dead. A woman, a nurse, was kidnapped, gang-raped for days and then cut alive on a mechanical wood-cutting machine. On the roads, people from the majority community"

* The two largest south Asian communities in Britain came from Sylhet and Mirpur, two impoverished parts of rural Bangladesh and Pakistani Kashmir. Between them, people of Bangladeshi and Pakistani origin made up nearly 2 percent of the UK’s population and had some of the worst indicators

* I noticed Hindu Military Hotel—“military” meant they served chicken and mutton.

* There was even such a thing as the “RSS honeymoon,” when bride and groom, in an inoculation against Western decadence and purportedly un-Indian values, would set off on a holiday after their wedding accompanied by the groom’s extended family.
