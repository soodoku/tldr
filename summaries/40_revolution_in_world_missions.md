## Revolution in World Missions

TL;DR: 

1. West should do more to evangelize in Asia. 
2. The primary purpose of church is not social work but evangelism --- see pg. 107, 170 (Church's primary task), etc.
3. How to evangelize:   
   *  Let go of idea of solely supporting White missionaries. Within country (South India to North, etc. more important)
   * Evangelize in a way that is 'native' (see pg. 147)
