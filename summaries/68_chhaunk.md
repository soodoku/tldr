### Fun Facts and Snark

* During my first time in Egypt, some thirty years ago, I tasted something they called koshari, a dish comprising rice and brown lentils with tomato sauce, a garnish of browned onions and, unexpectedly, some macaroni...Koshari comes from khichdi, a gift from the Indian soldiers stationed in Egypt, probably during the First World War.

* Indo-Chinese Food: In principle, I want to celebrate that. Just not by eating it.

* In 2020–21, according to the World Bank, there were 962 cash transfer programmes spread across 203 countries covering 1.36 billion people.

* Seems like India consumes more meat per capita than Bangladesh?
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_meat_consumption
    so this is already not true: "It turns out that per capita annual meat consumption is very similar in India and Bangladesh, and very little (4 kilograms a year)."

* In India, proportion of 'wasted' children hasn't really changed much, it seems

* Seema Jayachandran (from Princeton) and Rohini Pande (from Yale) shows,14 while the average Indian child is shorter than the average child in the much poorer countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the oldest male child in Indian families is actually taller. 
    - Had come to similar conclusions earlier: The same facts also tell us that while unsanitary conditions, unclean water and the resulting prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases is an important reason why Indians grow up short, it cannot be the whole story since (a) open defecation is an even bigger problem in many African countries and (b) firstborn boys and other children from the same families presumably grow up under the same environmental conditions.

    - Jayachandran and Pande’s assessment is that this misallocation of resources within the family can, by itself, explain perhaps half of the India–Africa gap

* The recent EAT–Lancet reference diet15 suggests that people should get 29 per cent of their calories from proteins. While there is probably a margin of error, the recent estimate16 by a team led by Manika Sharma at International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in Delhi suggests that rural Indians get just 6 per cent of their calories from proteins, ...Even the richest Indians in the National Sample Survey (NSS) data get only about half of the recommended amount.

* A remarkable 77 per cent of those imprisoned in India have not been convicted; they are waiting to be tried. More than a quarter of those have been in jail for a year or more, nearly 3 per cent for more than five years. ... In 1979, a Law Commission complained about it. The ratio of undertrials among the imprisoned was then 58 per cent (now it’s nearly 80 per cent). 


* [India has] 21 sanctioned judgeships per million population (while the US has 150) and only two-thirds of these are currently filled.

### Origins of Taste ... (but why?)

* In fact, gastronomy, as a category, is clearly associated with the rise of the bourgeoisie and its desire to challenge the aristocracy’s hold on the high culture of France. It was not mere plenty that signalled the arrival of a new dominant class, but also the refinement of taste, exemplified by the very architectural cakes and pastries that Antonin Carême made famous in early-nineteenth-century Paris.

### Origins of MNREGA

* We decided to visit the Bada Imambara during the two hours before the flight. This is an enormous prayer hall from the 1780s, sponsored by the then Nawab of Awadh, Asaf-ud-Daulah, in response to a terrible drought and the resulting famine. It was a food-for-work programme – anyone who came for work on the building project got some basic provisions.
    * There is a famous maze inside the Imambara called the ‘bhool bhulaiya’. The guide we took to avoid getting lost told us an interesting story about it. Apparently, the local upper classes were also starving – not surprising, given that they, too, lived off the land. The nawab knew that they were too proud to show up for work with the everyday labourers. So, instead, he paid them to come hidden in the dark of the night through the bhool bhulaiya to demolish a part of the day’s work.

* It was only during the awful 1838 Agra famine – which Ms Eden was writing about – that a clear policy of providing public employment to the needy, much like in Lucknow and Pilibhit, emerged. However, Fanny Eden’s brother, the Governor-General, made sure that these jobs would pay so little that only those who had no choice would take them. And to make it more acceptable to the devotees of economic rationality, the plan was to put the labour to good use: to build irrigation canals that would raise productivity and prevent famines, and roads to move grains to where there was scarcity. In fact, many of these got built.
    * I wonder if past famines cause future productivity for this reason

* Getting a widow’s pension in Delhi, a study by the World Bank’s Sarika Gupta13 tells us, requires two visits, on average, to the local MLA among the many tedious and/or humiliating steps.


### Food For Thought

* maybe the reason why we, in India, eat with our hands has something to do with the fact that the water is rarely too cold to wash off the grease.

* Likewise, the shift away from eating with one’s hands in Europe was part of a general cultural move towards self-restraint – in bodily functions (no more farting and belching in public), in the expressions of sexual appetite, in violence against animals and other human beings; the animal now came to the table pre-carved rather than getting hacked into pieces then and there. My instinct is to connect it to the fact that, until fairly recently, to be regal was to be virile. Kings were meant to be strong (in terms of their bodies and their will), sexually potent and great gorgers. The display of appetite and strength was a part of the legitimation process. The rise of more managerial

*  In the great Bengali comic writer Parashuram’s Ulot Puran, India has conquered Britain, and Britain’s Indian-appointed governor wants to eat mangoes like the Indians do, and is hiding in the toilet, dripping with mango juice, practicing. 

* Deadweight Loss of Valentine's Day: On the other hand, none of the significant others in [Waldfogel's] data gave cash gifts.

### Psych. by Economists

* Economists call this the ‘dual-self’ problem. There’s your present self, who takes great pride and pleasure in announcing to the world (and, indeed, to themselves) their plan to lose five kilograms. Starting tomorrow. And then there is your future self, who agrees as long as it starts a day later. 

* Our research on why parents in India often fail to fully vaccinate their children has a lot in common with the dual-self problem. One self knows that it needs to be done. The other suggests that it could wait till tomorrow, especially since there is housework to be done, and your child will surely scream her head off when she sees the needle. But a promise of a small gift when they show up to the vaccination camp alters that calculus entirely. There is something to look forward to right now, not just the stress of finishing cooking in time and the unpleasantness of a mewling child in exchange for some future benefit. **We find that this can more than double the vaccination rates.** (I looked this up.)

**Perhaps the right strategy for that difficult moment in front of the store that sells the delicious chocolate cake or the very tempting big bottle of Coke, is to promise oneself something small but very nice upon reaching home – like a small piece of dark chocolate,** a bite of aam papad rolled in delicious churan, or a fragment of a freshly made kanchagolla with gur still seeping out of it. **The more general point is that commitments work best when they are not entirely divorced from pleasure.**

* Our cognition is a slave to our affective mind. But for the poor, this can be a double whammy: they are robbed of their ability to think clearly and act decisively precisely when they need it the most – when their entire survival is at stake. This might help us understand why, during the monga months of March–April and September–November – when there is no work available in the fields – a large fraction of the poorest families in Rangpur in North-West Bangladesh ends up living on a starvation diet of 1,400 calories a day or less, even though there is work available in the cities. Those who take up the option of finding temporary work in the city can afford a more comfortable 2,200 calories a day for their families. As the fascinating research by Gharad Bryan, Shyamal Chowdhury and Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak ...

### Economics Causes Culture

* In the 1960s and 1970s, which is when my memories of the mother-in-law’s power date from, most people I knew – mostly Bengali and middle-class – lived in joint families. Housing was scarce, decent jobs were few and far between, so it made sense for all the brothers and unmarried/widowed sisters to crowd into the old family house with their wives and children, sharing whatever little income there was.

* When I joined JNU for my master’s in economics, the top group in the admission list included me – the child of two economics professors – but also a son of a farming family that had barely enough land to live on, and several others from SC/ST families that owned small businesses or held low-level government jobs in smaller towns, for whom Delhi was a remote and exciting place. They were very different from my Kolkata friends – equally bright, but much more political, with greater awareness of India’s ground reality, the depredations of caste and poverty, and the way the system works and fails. 
    * Econ. and 'taste'
        * On the other hand, they never talked about food – my daily obsession – faced with the disastrous hostel meals. .. Most days there was enough rice and dal. You take what you get and move on. Perhaps grumbling about the cooking only makes sense to those who don’t have to worry about paying the school fees or repairing the roof.

* Economics causes culture causes economics
    * That vocabulary allows me, on and off through the day, to contemplate what I will cook or eat, and makes my everyday special. But it also opens the door to the world of food conversations, connecting me to people who might otherwise have no interest in me. Food talk is a social adhesive. In being brought up with it, I was privileged in ways that affirmative action will not directly fix: those who grew up – because they had no choice – treating food purely instrumentally, are robbed of something precious in life, and the social power that comes with

* Econ. causes cuisine
    There were always those who had to make the most of very little – hence, minestrone, the wonderful Italian vegetable soup flavoured by tiny morsels of fatback, or bland tofu lifted by a few ounces of ground meat (and some Szechwan chilli paste) into the marvellous mapo tofu, or the infinitely delicate suralichi ki vadi (aka khandvi) made from everyday besan and dahi. While abundance obviously makes life easier, this history reminds us that being constrained teaches us to use ingredients purposefully and makes us find ways of turning the mundane into the special.

* Old Problem
    -  An increasing fraction of families had one or more children working in Bangalore, Bahrain or Boston. Many parents suddenly found themselves living mostly alone, as my mother did for so many years. The same transition was also happening among the less well-off families, if at a somewhat slower pace. The number of children was dropping everywhere – the average fertility rate dropped from above four in the 1970s

    - As a result, the all-India proportion of elderly not living with children doubled between 2000 and 2010, and has surely gone up a lot since.

    - Despite our narrative about family-oriented India being entirely unlike the individualistic United States, the fraction of elderly who, in surveys, say that they are lonely, is similar in both countries – about 15 per cent. And in Tamil Nadu – which had an earlier and sharper fertility decline rate than North India, and is more urbanized – loneliness is much higher, closer to 30 per cent.

* Climate and Econ. Causes Culture
    * There are estimates that the number of households in India with air conditioning will go up fifteen-fold by 2050. This would be a very different India: an enormous part of today’s ...elites happens in the streets and the neighbourhoods, in college courtyards and roadside dhabas, through tennis-ball cricket and pavement badminton. If people stop going out for a big part of the year because it is too hot and wrap themselves in their air-conditioned cocoons, if mothers stop children from going out to play, if friends no longer congregate in ramshackle tea shops or under some shady tree (as we used to), if relatives don’t not walk over for random visits, the society will be unrecognizably altered without




### Government Policies Cause Culture + Culture as Self-Fulfilling

* Bengali culture, as the cliché goes, is more devoted to eating and travelling than to making money, in contrast particularly with the culture of the immigrants from western India, long settled in Bengal. There are potential historical roots to this divergence – for example, the British systematically undermined the early nineteenth-century boom in Bengali-run businesses. Also, these communities came to Bengal precisely to do business. And in any case, today, most Bengali would-be entrepreneurs suffer from not having other entrepreneurs to learn and get loans from, unlike, for example, the Gujaratis and Marwaris in Bengal.

### Weber and The Problem of Explaining Within Country Change

* At some point, to fit the data, Weber’s theory had to be extended to include all of Christianity, Judaism and Confucianism. Will Hinduism be next, notwithstanding the cliché of it being other-worldly? Moreover, while South Korea is now often cited as a shining example of a Confucian success story, in the 1960s, there was a lot of anxiety – in Korea and beyond it – about the same Confucianism, and its emphasis on high thinking and scholarly pursuits rather than manual labour and business creation.
