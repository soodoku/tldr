See also: Jennifer Hochschild's 1981 book "What's Fair: American Beliefs about Distributive Justice." Hoschschild begins her book with an excerpt from Arthur Conan Doyle's story, Silver Blaze, featuring the popular fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. In the excerpt, Holmes remarks on the curious fact that the dog didn't bark even when the evidence suggested that it should have. Hochschild uses this analogy to remark on the "curious" fact about the American polity---that it has steadfastly shied away from socialism, even socialist rhetoric, despite rising inequality, and the large pool of likely beneficiaries of socialist policies.

See also Sven Steinmo for his work on political culture ~ the pull yourself up the bootstraps entrepreneurial anti-statist immigrant culture. A lack of feudal history, the rapid rise of petite bourgeoisie, people being better off than their parents during at least much of the 19th and 20th century as the vast natural resources of US were exploited to carve out wealth, are other plausible contributing reasons for belief in the American Dream.
