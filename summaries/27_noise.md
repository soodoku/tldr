#### Noisy Facts

1. "A study of cases that were randomly allotted to different judges found that one judge admitted 5% of applicants, while another admitted 88%." https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2914&context=facpub

2. More experienced patent examiners seem to grant patents at higher rates (about 10% higher). https://users.nber.org/~confer/2008/si2008/IPPI/lemley.pdf

3. In 1977, for example, William Austin and Thomas Williams conducted a survey of forty-seven judges, asking them to respond to the same five cases, each involving low-level offenses. All the descriptions of the cases included summaries of the information used by judges in actual sentencing, such as the charge, the testimony, the previous record (if any), social background, and evidence relating to character. 
	5 cases: 38.3% guilty + 70.2% guilty + 87.2% guilty + (100% + 57.4%) guilty + 95.7% guilty ~> 74%

    sentencing varies more but harder to quantify the variation

4. Effect of sentencing commission: " According to another study, the expected difference in sentence length between judges was 17%, or 4.9 months, in 1986 and 1987. That number fell to 11%, or 3.9 months, between 1988 and 1993."
