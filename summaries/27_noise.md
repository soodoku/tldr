### Noise

#### Types of Noise

* System noise = total error

* Occasion noise is the variability in judgments of the same case by the same person or group on different occasions.

* Level noise: some raters harder than others. 

* Pattern noise = idiosyncratic error (judge-case variation)

#### Judgy Professions

1. Doctors
2. Case workers
3. Judges
4. Underwriters
5. Patent

#### Noisy Facts

1. More experienced patent examiners seem to grant patents at higher rates (about 10% higher). https://users.nber.org/~confer/2008/si2008/IPPI/lemley.pdf

2. Judges

    * "A study of cases that were randomly allotted to different judges found that one judge admitted 5% of applicants, while another admitted 88%." https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2914&context=facpub

    * In 1977, for example, William Austin and Thomas Williams conducted a survey of forty-seven judges, asking them to respond to the same five cases, each involving low-level offenses. All the descriptions of the cases included summaries of the information used by judges in actual sentencing, such as the charge, the testimony, the previous record (if any), social background, and evidence relating to character. 
	5 cases: 38.3% guilty + 70.2% guilty + 87.2% guilty + (100% + 57.4%) guilty + 95.7% guilty ~> 74%

        sentencing varies more but harder to quantify the variation

    * Effect of sentencing commission: " According to another study, the expected difference in sentence length between judges was 17%, or 4.9 months, in 1986 and 1987. That number fell to 11%, or 3.9 months, between 1988 and 1993."

    * Judges more lenient on defendant's birthday ~ 1--3% in France. https://www.iast.fr/publications/clash-norms-judicial-leniency-defendant-birthdays (seems too big)
    
    * 16 hypothetical cases in which the defendant had been found guilty and was to be sentenced. The vignettes depicted either robberies or cases of fraud and differed on six other dimensions, including whether the defendant was a principal or an accomplice, prior criminal record, whether a weapon was used in the robbery, etc.

    Interviewed a national sample of 208 active federal judges. In the course of ninety minutes, the judges decided on 16 cases.
                
    For the average case, the mean sentence was 7.0 years, and the standard deviation around that mean was 3.4 years.

    Since mean absolute diff. = 1.13 SD if distribution is normal, mean absolute diff = 3.8 years.

    Level noise (some judges harsher than others): The standard deviation of the values in the rightmost column was 2.4 years.

3. Underwriters + Claims adjusters
    * To prepare for the noise audit, executives of the company constructed detailed descriptions of five representative cases for each group (underwriters and adjusters). Employees were asked to evaluate two or three cases each, working independently. They were not told that the purpose of the study was to examine the variability of their judgments.
    * Most executives of the insurance company guessed 10%
    * Our noise audit found much greater differences. By our measure, the median difference in underwriting was 55%, about five times as large
    * For claims adjusters, the median ratio was 43%. We stress that these results are medians: in half the pairs of cases, the difference between the two judgments was even larger. 

4. Investors: They asked forty-two experienced investors in the firm to estimate the fair value of a stock (the price at which the investors would be indifferent to buying or selling). The investors based their analysis on a one-page description of the business; the data included simplified profit and loss, balance sheet, and cash flow statements for the past three years and projections for the next two. Median noise, measured in the same way as in the insurance company, was 41%.

5. Wine "experts": "When wine experts at a major US wine competition tasted the same wines twice, they scored only 18% of the wines identically" https://www.sjakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Robert-Hodgson-Tasting-Unconsistent.pdf

6. Too little data: "In this paper, we report from an experiment where seven experienced software professionals estimated the same sixty software development tasks over a period of three months. Six of the sixty tasks were estimated twice. We found a high degree of inconsistency in the software professionalsâ€™ effort estimates. The mean difference of the effort estimates of the same task by the same estimator was as much as 71%. The correlation between the corresponding estimates was 0.7." https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0164121207000714
