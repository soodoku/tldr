## Who Gets What and Why (Alvin Roth)

### 1. Thin Markets

Every field of wheat can be a little different. For that reason, wheat used to be sold “by sample”—that is, buyers would take a sample of the wheat and evaluate it before making an offer to buy. It was a cumbersome process, and it often involved buyers and sellers who had successfully transacted in the past maintaining a relationship with one another....

**Solutions**

1. In the late 1800s, the economist William Stanley Jevons pointed out that the invention of money was a market design solution that overcame a major problem that severely limited barter, namely the need to find someone who both has what you want and wants what you have.

2. Grading/Classification
	1. The Chicago Board of Trade made wheat into a commodity by classifying it on the basis of its quality (number 1 being the best) and type (winter or spring, hard or soft, red or white). This meant that the railroads could mix wheat of the same grade and type instead of keeping each farmer’s crop segregated during shipping. It also meant that over time, buyers would learn to rely on the grading system and buy their wheat without 
	2. Coffee: If you wanted to buy Ethiopian coffee in bulk at the source, you had to have an agent there who could extract a sample from deep inside each sack to taste and evaluate it. That changed in 2008 with the creation of the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange. At its heart is a system of anonymous coffee grading, in which professional tasters sample ... tasting must be “blind”; the tasters can’t know whose beans they’re tasting. Otherwise, they could be bribed by the seller to inflate the grades.

### 2. Unraveling

(Non-thick markets ...)

Unraveled Markets: market collapses because participants begin to act too early or hide information. College applications, etc.

Classic paper: https://web.stanford.edu/~alroth/papers/RothAndXing1994.pdf

Most of the markets mentioned in Table 1 are entry-level labor markets for professionals. Timing problems are particularly easy to identify in these markets, because while employment contracts can be signed at any time, employment itself typically begins only following the attainment of the necessary professional qualifications, such as graduation from medical, law, or business school, or university

**Issues**
1. Hiring more than a year before the start of employment made it difficult for law firms to forecast their demand. Thus thousands of summer associates at large firms who’d accepted “permanent” offers shortly after their second-year summer associateships in August 2008 saw them rescinded or deferred before they started work in the autumn of 2009. Some of the firms, to maintain their reputations and their relationships, paid those deferred employees a portion of their starting salaries and encouraged them to spend a year doing pro bono work—an outcome
2. Making decisions when participants know less. For instance, medical students may not know about their interests when applying for specialization,
3. Strategic behavior and imperfect info...means a reduction in match quality. For instance, a clerkship applicant has to bet on whether or not they will get a better clerkship. 

**Solutions**

1. Clearinghouse. 
	1. Not clear why it is optimal for someone lower down the food chain.
2. Binding agreement around timing. Doesn't seem to work.

### Congestion

The issue with thick markets ....

The problem may come from trouble sifting desirable + interested from desirable + not so interested. Desirability may be easy to do but interest may be harder?

Auctions, Central exams, etc. seem like we should be able to clear effectively in many other cases.

**Solutions**

1. Costly signals. Applicants show interest. I can see why this can be a bad idea. Depends on how well applicants can do this. Risk aversion, etc., can all play a part.
	1. Muriel's work. "The AEA coordinates a mechanism through which applicants can signal their interest in receiving an interview at the January meetings. **In mid-November, each registered _JOE_ candidate on the economics job market will have the opportunity to register and designate no more than two departments (or other employers) to whom to send a signal of particular interest.**" https://www.aeaweb.org/joe/signal/

### Fun Facts

1. Concentration in the credit card industry
	 The 10 largest credit card firms by purchase volume in the U.S. accounted for 83.01% of the market share in 2023 vs. 2/5th in 1990

2. Gale and Shapley weren't the first: "clearly formulated until ten years later, in a 1962 article by David Gale and Lloyd Shapley with the intriguing title “College Admissions and the Stability of Marriage.” The two authors didn’t know about the Match, but they formulated an algorithm for finding stable matchings that I later discovered was equivalent to the one the doctors had adopted for the 1952 clearinghouse. Gale and Shapley called their version the deferred acceptance algorithm"
   
4. "Before 1900, doctors graduated from medical school and immediately began to “practice” medicine without further supervision"

### Asides

1.  “the Iron Law of Marriage,” which says that you can’t be happier than your spouse.
2. “What do you know when you see a green plant in the desert?” he asked. I shook my head, and he exclaimed: “It’s poison! Otherwise something would have eaten it by now.”
