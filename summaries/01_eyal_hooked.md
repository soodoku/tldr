# Hooked

### Chapter 1
    - Aim: unprompted user engagement, bringing users back repeatedly
    
    - Hook Model:
        1. Trigger: External or Internal
        2. Action: Behavior done in anticipation of reward
            - Make it easier to do X
            - Psych. motivation to do X
        3. Variable Reward:
            - Variability in reward: activates parts associated with wanting and desire.
        4. Investment:
            - User puts something into the product: time, data, effort, social capital, money - increases odds that they will come back again
    
    - Paul Graham:
        - The world will get more addictive in next 40 years than it did in the last forty

    - Def. of Habit:
        - Behaviors done with little or no conscious thought

### Chapter 1: Habit Zone

    - Customer Life Time Value:
        - Amount of Money spent by customer before they switch to customer, die, stop using product
        - Habits increase CLTV
        - Credit card CLTV --- very high

    - How to exploit?
        - Provide Flexible Pricing:
            - First form habit (say free-to-play video game) and then charge
        
        - Why Hook? 
            - Hooked users evangelize, bring other users into the product
        
        - More is more principle:
            - more frequent usage drivers more viral growth

        - Viral Cycle Time:
            - Amount of time it takes a user to invite another user

        - QWERTY designed to keep commonly used characters apart as to prevent jamming of keys. Dvorak keyboard better. 

        - Building New Habits
            - Sometimes = Replacing some Past Behaviors/Habits
            - Habits are last in, first out
                - Habits learned last, first to go

        - Get people to do same thing more frequently to form habit
            - Floss twice a day perhaps for 1 month? versus once a day for a month
            - Infrequent behaviors may never become habitual

        - Investors ask
            - Are you building a vitamin or a painkiller?
            - Painkillers solve an obvious need, relieving a specific pain
            - Vitamins appeal to users' emotional/functional needs

        - Habit 
            - when not doing an action causes pain (really closer to an itch that needs to be scratched)
            - by that def., FB is creating a painkiller. you are selling crack to a crack addict whose addiction you created.

### Chapter 2: Trigger

* External Triggers:
    - Paid Triggers: ads
    - Earned Triggers: press mentions etc. 
    - Relationship Triggers: one person telling other
    - Owned Trigger: App placement on the phone home screen

* Internal Triggers:
    - Feeling bad etc. 

* Goal of habit forming product:
    - association between pain and product/service as source of relief

* People want to do things they have always done. (Evan Williams)
    - For business opportunities look for difference between Declared preferences and revealed preferences. Focus on revealed

* How to get to the basic of what people want ---
    - Ask Why --- '5 Whys Method' --- Taiichi Ohno of the Toyota Production System
    - Why would Julie want to use email?
        - Send and receive messages.
            - Why would she want to do that?
                - Share and receive information quickly 
                    - Why?
                        + To know whats going on lives
                            * Why?
                                - to know if someone needs her
                                    + Why?
                                        * Fears being out of loop
    
    - Instagram internal trigger
        + Fear of losing a 'special moment'
        - Fear of missing out (FOMO

### Action

* What Drives Action (Fogg): B (behavior) = MAT
    - Motivation 
    - Ability to complete desired action
    - Trigger

* Motivation:
    - All humans motivated to seek pleasure, avoid pain, seek hope, avoid or overcome fear, seek social acceptance and avoid rejection
    - Sex sells
    - Beer ad showing friends cheering for win:
        + postive association with friendship

* Ability
    - Technology that makes it easy to accomplish a task will enjoy high adoption rates by people it assists (Hauptly)
    - Take a human desire --- preferably around for a long time --- identify that desire and use technology to take out steps (Evan Williams)

    - Six elements of simplicity:
        + Time
        + Money
        + Physical Effort
        + Brain Cycles
        + Social deviance --- how accepted is behavior by others
        + Non routine --- action matches or disrupts existing routines

* Behavioral Econ. insight:
    - Appearance of scarcity affected perceived value
    - Framing Effect
        + Price of wine caused people to enjoy wine more (fmri)
    - Anchoring Effect
    - Endowed Progress Effect
        + Both loyalty punch cards --- 8 car washes for free. But one came with 10 dots + 2 free punches --- 82% higher completion rate
        + Linkedin uses -- X% complete
    - Stephen Anderson (Seductive Interaction Design)
        + Created Mental Notes --- each card contains description of cognitive bias

### Chapter 4: Variable Rewards

* What draws us to act is the need to alleviate the craving for the reward
    - Not the reward
* The stress of desire

* Three types of variable rewards:
    - Tribe --- social rewards
        + validation from others
    - Hunt ---
        + for something valuable, interesting tidbit etc.
        + potential job lead in an email
    - Self
        + Conquer obstacles, completing stuff, gain a sense of competency (Deci and Ryan) --- become better at video game, for instance
        + email also gives you sense of accomplishment --- tasks that need 
    
* Fun examples:
    - Quora --- offer social rewards to build up content. Mahalo offered money but failed.
    - Points, badges, leaderboards can be effective

* Increase compliance by adding the phrase:
    * "But you are free to accept or refuse"
    * Remind people of their freedom to choose
    * Place where you can offer advice to others, receive validation
        - anonymous can work for fitness

* Don't ask people to learn new things, make old routines easier/fulfilling existing needs

* Experience taking:
    - People who read a story about a character actually feel what protagonist is feeling

* Finite Variability
    - An experience that becomes predictable after use
    - Infinite variability ---> greater the chances person hooked

* Tangible Things to do:
    - What do customers find enjoyable or encouraging? Are there moments of surprised?

### Chapter 5: Investment

* Attitude change important for habit
    - Escalation of commitment can be used to manipulate
        + Putting up Drive Carefully signs
            * Previously asked to put up a much smaller sign
    
    - Rationalization 
        - The more time and effort users invest -> more they value
        - More likely to be consistent with past behaviors
        - We change our pref. to avoid cognitive dissonance
    
    - We value our efforts at a high rate:
        + Those who made their own origami valued it as much as made by experts
        + IKEA Effect --- asking people to build their furniture causes them to love it

    - Example of stored value that cause people to return:
        + Putting a song in iTunes
        + People who put more info. on Linkedin -> more likely to return
        + Collected followers
        + Reputation --- stored value
        + Skill learning stuff
    
* Practical Tips:
    - What work are users doing to increase likelihood of returning
    - Adding small investment into product:
        + Load the next trigger
        + Store value data, content, followers, reputation, skill
        + Identify how long it takes for a 'loaded trigger.' How can we reduce delay.

### Chapter 6: What are you going to do with this?

* Five fundamental questions for building effective hooks: 
    - What do users really want? What pain is your product relieving? (Internal Trigger)
    - What brings users to your service? (External)
    - Simplest action users take in anticipation of reward. How can you make it simpler? (Action)
    - Are users fulfilled but want more (Variable rewards)
    - Bit of work that users invest?

* Manipulation Matrix
    - Materially improves user life/doesn't improve * Maker uses it/doesn't use it
    - Facilitator: someone who uses it and useful for people
    - Peddler: doesn't use it/but useful for people
    - Dealer: doesn't use it, doesn't help people
    - Entertainer: uses it but doesn't help people

### Chapter 7: Use Case

* Bible App:
    - Should look into creating apps for indian religious crap
    - Mobile --- a device people always have
    - Which verse is chosen for the day --- becomes god's way of cuing
    - Share the verse of the day 
        + Humblebrag
        + Spread it socially
    - annotation etc. people make on the app -> stored value
