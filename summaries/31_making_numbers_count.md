## Making Numbers Count

### Aims

* Accurate Recall
* Better comprehension
* Impactful

### Psych.

* Can't process large numbers -> psychophysical numbing
* Can't hold a lot of numbers. Miller --- 7 +/- 2
	- can be 7 chunks, e.g., Bay Area Code ~ 650
	- against needless precision
* Contextualize (to something relatable; choose 'familiar' units), e.g., Pakistan is ~ twice the size of California
* Visceral recalled better?

### Techniques

* Round numbers
	* http://dangoldstein.com/papers/Nguyen_Hofman_Goldstein_rounding_numbers_CHI_2022_preprint.pdf
	* But baseball fans like 3 decimal reporting for batting average, etc. So prorate by the audience.
	* Improves accurate recall plus other downstreaming processing

* Simplify fractions
	- round denominators
		- 31/50 -> 31/100 -> 62%

* Natural frequencies than percentages, esp. for percentages < 1
	* e.g., .2% --- 1 in 500
	* X% hungry to -> of every 100 people, X would go hungry

* Smaller denominators are more effective
	- 65 out of every 100 wounded soliders died of infections << 3 out of every 5 wounded soliders died of infections

* Provide context for numbers
	- $61B on SNAP -> $1.37 per meal per person

* Convert to familiar units (which can be objects, concepts like calendar time, distance you need to travel, etc.)
	* Fathom, Mile, etc.
	* e.g., social distance ~ length of a tatami mat
	* When choosing units
		- More familiar the better, try famous
		- More concrete the better
		- Choose things of similar scale
			+ Scale conversion shouldn't be like 72x. For instance, social distance ~ 72 pistachios would be awful.
		- Choose a 'squarer' geography for comparison: 1x japan < 4x portugal

	* Try translating to a different dimension, e.g., time, space, distance, money, etc.
		- Conveying the sense of scale: A million seconds is 12 days. A billion seconds is 32 years.
		- 1 in a million as chance of getting the date correct between 500 BC and 2200
		- Harry Potter 6 volumes (total 7) have 1 m words. Circle one word with red. Chance of picking the same word you have marked when you first open the book at random and point the finger to a word.
		- Trying to balance the budget by eliminating the NEA would be like editing a 90,000-word novel by eliminating 4 words.
		- A single M&M has 4 calories. In order to burn off the calories in a single M&M, you’d have to walk 2 flights of stairs.
		- Co2 from cows > emissions from India, etc.
		- Eisenhower chance for peace ~  1 modern heavy bomber = 30 schools, 2 power plants (**choice of units can be done w/ persuasion in mind**)
		- Drinking a 12-oz. serving of Ocean Spray Cran-Apple juice is the sugar equivalent of 3 glazed donuts from Krispy Kreme… plus 4 sugar cubes.
		- If you bought and drank a bottle of Evian, you could refill that bottle once a day for 10 years, 5 months, and 21 days with San Francisco tap water
		- To achieve Six Sigma as a baker, imagine baking a batch of 2 dozen chocolate chip cookies every night. You could do that for 37 years before finding a cookie that is burned..

* Scale model
	- GS: this works better for relative quantities than absolute. 
		+ e.g., Time from big bang to now -> calendar year (Carl Sagan)

* Encore (there is even more, ..., but it gets worse...)
	- Imagine having to guess which date someone is thinking of—any date between January 1 in the year 0001 (1 A.D.) and September 18 in the year 2667. If you match, you win the lottery prize. Just as they are about to hand you your check, they reveal that the fine print on your ticket requires passing one more hurdle. There are 300 identical envelopes on the wall. If you don’t pick the one that holds your check, you receive nothing.

* Category jumping
	+ e.g., if CA were a country, CA economy would be the world's fifth largest

* How to make it visceral 
	- in our personal space, e.g., wealth inequality = imagine 100 people and 100 apartments, 49 owned by 1 person, rest of the X share the same apartment 
	- happening here and now
	- happening to us 
		+ e.g., “Look to your left, look to your right. One of the three of you won’t be joining us next fall” 
		+ if you spent the same portion of weekly income on food as Kenyans do, 7 days of eating would cost you $650 for dishes like cornmeal porridge and potato pea mash.
	- GS: recast error as deliberate action
		+ “It is as criminal to have a mortality of… 19… per 1,000 in the Line, Artillery and Guards in England, when that of Civil life is only 11 per 1,000, as it would be to take 1,100 men per annum out upon Salisbury Plain and shoot them.” (Nightingale)
	- visualize it for the reader in ways that communicate scale (NY Times sharing a spread of COVID deaths)


* When skewed, lots of opportunities for impactful comparisons
	- e.g., More men names James as Fortune 500 CEOs than women
	- e.g., Smoky mountains receives 2x the visitors of the next most visited national park, which is Grand Canyon
	- e.g., Amazon 
		+  4 of the next 11 biggest rivers already flow into it
		+  If the other 7 were combined, Amazon would still be bigger
