## Making Numbers Count

### Aims

* Accurate Recall
* Better comprehension
* Impactful 

### Psych.

* Can't process large numbers -> psychophysical numbing
* Can't hold a lot of numbers. Miller --- 7 +/- 2
	- can be 7 chunks, e.g., Bay Area Code ~ 650
	- against needless precision

### Techniques

* Simplify where possible
	* 31/50 -> 62%

* Natural Frequencies than percentages
	* e.g., .2% --- 1 in 500

* Round numbers

	* But baseball fans like 3 decimal reporting for batting average, etc.
	* Improves accurate recall plus other downstreaming processing

* Compare to something familiar
	* Cubit, Fathom, Mile, etc. 
	* Choose something that is ~ 1x
	* e.g., social distance ~ length of a tatami mat than say 72 pistachios
	* Choose a 'squarer', more familiar geography for comparison: 1x japan < 4x portugal
	* Choose something famous

* Make it visceral
	- in our personal space, happening here and now, happening to us

* Ideas
	- Try translating to a different dimension, e.g., time, space, distance, money, etc.
		- Conveying the sense of scale: A million seconds is 12 days. A billion seconds is 32 years.
		- 1 in a million as chance of getting the date correctly between 500 BC and 2200
		- Harry Potter 6 volumes (total 7) have 1 m words. Circle one word with red. Chance of picking the same word you have marked when you first open the book at random and point the finger to a word.
		- Trying to balance the budget by eliminating the NEA would be like editing a 90,000-word novel by eliminating 4 words.
		- A single M&M has 4 calories. In order to burn off the calories in a single M&M, youâ€™d have to walk 2 flights of stairs.


* Average can be more easily interpreted than the total and triggers certain kinds of interpretations
		- $27T in debt versus say $82k/person
	- Use prototypical example



* Apples to Apples may not be the best. Use relatable experience.
	* Impactful
		- Olympus Mons is more than 2x the height of Mt. Everest
		- The jet would fly into it midslope
* More men names James as Fortune 500 CEOs than women

* Convert to calendar/clock time
	*
