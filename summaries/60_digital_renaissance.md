## Digital Renaissance

### Declining Cost of Production of Movies

1. Prior to 2000, movies were shot with very expensive cameras requiring film, which was costly to buy, develop, and edit. While Hollywood studios tended to rent their cameras from Panavision, sources indicate that each camera cost roughly a quarter of a million dollars. Daily rentals of a professional-quality camera averaged $1,000.

2. Between 2002 and 2005, various firms including Sony, Red, and Arri introduced digital motion-picture cameras targeted at professionals. These cameras cost roughly a quarter of what film cameras of comparable quality cost. ... In 2002, George Lucas shot the first major film in high-definition (HD) digital, Star Wars: Episode 2

3. Then, in 2008, Canon introduced the EOS 5D Mark II. While mainly a still camera, it used interchangeable lenses and was also capable of shooting professional-quality HD video. Priced at $2,000, this camera made it possible for independent filmmakers to achieve professional-quality results.
